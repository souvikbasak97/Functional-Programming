## Hangman Game

At the start of the game,
one player secretly enters a word. Another player then tries to deduce the word via a series of guesses. For each guess, we indicate which letters in the secret word occur in the guess, and the game ends when the guess is correct.

For example, here is how the game might proceed if the secret word was Paris:<br/>
 hangman
Think of a word:<br/>
-----<br/>
Try to guess it:<br/>
? lisbon<br/>
---is<br/>
? berlin<br/>
--ri-<br/>
? monaco<br/>
-a---<br/>
? paris<br/>
You got it!!
